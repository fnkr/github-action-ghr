# [github-action-ghr](https://github.com/fnkr/github-action-ghr)

GitHub Action to upload build artifacts to GitHub releases using [ghr](https://github.com/tcnksm/ghr).
The action will trigger on pushes to tags and exit neutrally otherwise.

## Secrets

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — **Required.** Grants access to the repository.

## Variables

- `GHR_PATH` — **Required.**
  Path to the artifacts you want to upload.
  You can specify a file or a directory.
  If you provide a directory, all files in that directory will be uploaded.

- `GHR_COMPRESS` — **Optional.**
  Compress files before uploading them.
  Can be either `gz`, `bz2` or `xz`.
  The correct file extension will be appended (e.g. `.tar.gz`).

## Usage example
